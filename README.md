## Here are the 3 things I did. 

#The font doesnâ€™t match the new theme, please change the existing font to something that matches.                                                                                                   #Get rid of the basketball and the camera at the bottom of the page.                                                                                                                                #Replace Font Awesome with Material Icons - https://material.io/icons/


I was going to do the css to the scss, but my Gui was having SO many issues, that istead of not doing one, I did another one. 

My most challenging one was the Font Awesome to Material Icons one... it took me a minute that I had to download it and implement it. 

But the part I had the hardest time with was just pulling up the assignment with homestead and laravel. (as you already know). 

I think that is what I want to work on the most after this. Understand more of laravel and github.
